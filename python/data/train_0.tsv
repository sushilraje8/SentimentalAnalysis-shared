Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .
Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .

Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .

This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
Utter mush ... conceited pap .
One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .

You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
-LRB- Swimfan -RRB- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .
Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .

Shallow , noisy and pretentious .
Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
As pedestrian as they come .
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .

Bad and baffling from the get-go .
An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .

Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .

Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .
Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .
Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .
